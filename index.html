1. Introduction
BankEruptCityCoin (BEC) is a meme-inspired utility token built on the principles of community support, financial redemption, and decentralized empowerment. It is a cryptocurrency by the people, for the people—created to turn hardship into hope and transform despair into opportunity.

---

2. Vision & Mission
Vision: To create a decentralized city where the community acts as the bank, enabling members to support one another in times of need.

Mission: BankEruptCityCoin’s mission is to provide a platform that empowers everyday individuals to lift each other up during moments of financial crisis—be it food insecurity, housing needs, or emergency expenses. We believe that the blockchain should serve humanity, and BankEruptCityCoin is the people’s bank, where everyone owns the vaults.

---

3. Origin Story
BankEruptCityCoin was born when three tech visionaries—Vitalik Buterin, Gavin Wood, and Werner Vogels—helped a close friend through a bankruptcy. Inspired by the power of community support and peer-to-peer aid, they envisioned a decentralized financial network where the community doesn't just speculate, but actively supports each other. Thus, BEC was minted.

4. Tokenomics

- Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 BEC
- Distribution:
  - Community Rewards: 40%
  - Founders and Advisors: 15% (2-year lock-up)
  - Ecosystem Growth & Development: 20%
  - Liquidity Pool: 15%
  - Reserve Fund (Charity/Emergency Grants): 10%
- Burn Policy:
  - Every transaction burns 10 BEC tokens
  - Every 90 days, an additional 5,000 BEC will be permanently burned
  - This burn mechanism will reduce supply over time, increasing scarcity and driving potential demand and appreciation.
- Utility: Donations, grants, tipping, community voting, NFT purchases, access to bots and virtual agents.
- Market Valuation: At listing, the market cap provides an immediate valuation snapshot, influenced by tokenomics and community sentiment. The fully undiluted market cap anticipates the token's future scalability.
